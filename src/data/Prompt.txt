  You are given:
  1) A CV JSON (CV_JSON)
  2) A job description (WORK_DESCRIPTION)
  3) Two placeholders: DATE (today’s ISO date) and NAME (company name).

  Your task: return ONLY the changed sections of the JSON needed to target this job, with no extra text before or after the JSON. After the JSON, if—and only if—the job description explicitly says to send the CV via email or another channel, write a single line noting that instruction and the address/URL.

  Hard constraints:
  - Do NOT modify: experiences, summary, name, role, contact.
  - Only modify: applyDetail and coreSkills.
  - Do NOT change skill category names. You may reorder or edit the skills lists inside each category.
  - Do NOT add anything related to .NET, C#, Golang, Java, or Angular.
  - No category may be empty.
  - Keep the exact JSON structure and formatting (valid JSON). Output must be only the changed sections object(s), not the entire CV.
  - Locale: use UK spelling where applicable.

  How to update applyDetail:
  - role: set to the job title from WORK_DESCRIPTION (fallback: keep existing if not specified).
  - company: set to NAME.
  - location: use the job’s stated location (fallback: “United Kingdom (Remote/Flexible)”).
  - jobType: infer (e.g., “Full-time”, “Contract”) from the post (fallback: keep existing).
  - salary: fill if the post provides a figure/range; else "".
  - applyDateTime: set to DATE in ISO format (e.g., 2025-10-28T00:00:00Z).
  - status: set to "Targeting".
  - link: put the job post/application URL if present; else "".
  - address: mirror any on-site/remote detail from the post (e.g., “Remote (UK-wide)”).

  How to optimize coreSkills:
  - Goal: make each category’s skills list tightly match the job description while staying truthful to the candidate’s background and avoiding forbidden tech.
  - Prefer exact matches to the job’s keywords; include close synonyms the job would accept (e.g., “IaC (Terraform)” if it says “Infrastructure as Code”).
  - Keep categories: Backend, Frontend, DevOps and Cloud, AI, Databases, Other.
  - You may reorder skills for relevance, remove less relevant ones, and add closely related items the candidate plausibly has (based on CV), but never add .NET/C#/Go/Java/Angular.
  - Ensure every category remains non-empty (at least 1–3 highly relevant items; 6–10 max per category).
  - Use concise, recruiter-friendly phrasing (e.g., “CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)”, “Kubernetes”, “AWS”, “FastAPI”, “PostgreSQL”, “Observability (ELK/Prometheus/Grafana)”, “Security (Secrets mgmt, IAM)”).

  Output format:
  - Return only the modified sections as a single valid JSON object with these top-level keys present only if modified:
    - "applyDetail": { ... }
    - "coreSkills": [ ... ]
  - After the JSON, if the job post instructs to email or use a special portal, add one plain sentence on a new line, e.g.:
    Instruction: Send your CV to hiring@company.com
  - No other commentary.

  Inputs:
  - CV_JSON:
